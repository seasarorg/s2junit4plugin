Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of&#xA;      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,&#xA;      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable&#xA;      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,&#xA;      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,&#xA;      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable&#xA;      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their&#xA;      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)&#xA;      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You&#xA;      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a&#xA;      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work&#xA;      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct&#xA;      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses&#xA;      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate&#xA;      as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the&#xA;      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without&#xA;      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You&#xA;      meet the following conditions:&#xA;&#xA;      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or&#xA;          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and&#xA;&#xA;      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;          stating that You changed the files; and&#xA;&#xA;      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works&#xA;          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and&#xA;          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,&#xA;          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of&#xA;          the Derivative Works; and&#xA;&#xA;      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its&#xA;          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must&#xA;          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained&#xA;          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not&#xA;          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one&#xA;          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed&#xA;          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or&#xA;          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,&#xA;          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and&#xA;          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents&#xA;          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and&#xA;          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution&#xA;          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside&#xA;          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided&#xA;          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed&#xA;          as modifying the License.&#xA;&#xA;      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and&#xA;      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions&#xA;      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or&#xA;      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,&#xA;      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with&#xA;      the conditions stated in this License.&#xA;&#xA;   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,&#xA;      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work&#xA;      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of&#xA;      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.&#xA;      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify&#xA;      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed&#xA;      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.&#xA;&#xA;   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade&#xA;      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,&#xA;      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the&#xA;      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.&#xA;&#xA;   7.

You are solely responsible for determining the&#xA;      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any&#xA;      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.&#xA;&#xA;   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,&#xA;      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,&#xA;      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly&#xA;      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be&#xA;      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,&#xA;      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a&#xA;      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the&#xA;      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,&#xA;      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all&#xA;      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor&#xA;      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&#xA;&#xA;   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing&#xA;      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,&#xA;      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&#xA;      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&#xA;      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only&#xA;      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf&#xA;      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,&#xA;      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability&#xA;      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason&#xA;      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&#xA;&#xA;   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.&#xA;&#xA;      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following&#xA;      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets &quot;[]&quot;&#xA;      replaced with your own identifying information.

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the&#xA;      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without&#xA;      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You&#xA;      meet the following conditions:&#xA;&#xA;      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or&#xA;          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and&#xA;&#xA;      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;          stating that You changed the files; and&#xA;&#xA;      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works&#xA;          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and&#xA;          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,&#xA;          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of&#xA;          the Derivative Works; and&#xA;&#xA;      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its&#xA;          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must&#xA;          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained&#xA;          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not&#xA;          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one&#xA;          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed&#xA;          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or&#xA;          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,&#xA;          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and&#xA;          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents&#xA;          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and&#xA;          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution&#xA;          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside&#xA;          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided&#xA;          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed&#xA;          as modifying the License.&#xA;&#xA;      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and&#xA;      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions&#xA;      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or&#xA;      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,&#xA;      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with&#xA;      the conditions stated in this License.&#xA;&#xA;   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,&#xA;      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work&#xA;      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of&#xA;      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.&#xA;      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify&#xA;      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed&#xA;      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.&#xA;&#xA;   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade&#xA;      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,&#xA;      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the&#xA;      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.&#xA;&#xA;   7.

You are solely responsible for determining the&#xA;      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any&#xA;      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.&#xA;&#xA;   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,&#xA;      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,&#xA;      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly&#xA;      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be&#xA;      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,&#xA;      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a&#xA;      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the&#xA;      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,&#xA;      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all&#xA;      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor&#xA;      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&#xA;&#xA;   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing&#xA;      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,&#xA;      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&#xA;      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&#xA;      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only&#xA;      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf&#xA;      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,&#xA;      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability&#xA;      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason&#xA;      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&#xA;&#xA;   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.&#xA;&#xA;      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following&#xA;      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets &quot;[]&quot;&#xA;      replaced with your own identifying information.

You may add Your own attribution&#xA;          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside&#xA;          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided&#xA;          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed&#xA;          as modifying the License.&#xA;&#xA;      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and&#xA;      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions&#xA;      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or&#xA;      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,&#xA;      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with&#xA;      the conditions stated in this License.&#xA;&#xA;   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,&#xA;      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work&#xA;      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of&#xA;      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.&#xA;      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify&#xA;      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed&#xA;      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.&#xA;&#xA;   6. Trademarks.

In no event and under no legal theory,&#xA;      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,&#xA;      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly&#xA;      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be&#xA;      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,&#xA;      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a&#xA;      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the&#xA;      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,&#xA;      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all&#xA;      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor&#xA;      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&#xA;&#xA;   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing&#xA;      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,&#xA;      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&#xA;      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&#xA;      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only&#xA;      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf&#xA;      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,&#xA;      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability&#xA;      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason&#xA;      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&#xA;&#xA;   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.&#xA;&#xA;      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following&#xA;      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets &quot;[]&quot;&#xA;      replaced with your own identifying information.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the&#xA;      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without&#xA;      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You&#xA;      meet the following conditions:&#xA;&#xA;      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or&#xA;          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and&#xA;&#xA;      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;          stating that You changed the files; and&#xA;&#xA;      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works&#xA;          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and&#xA;          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,&#xA;          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of&#xA;          the Derivative Works; and&#xA;&#xA;      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its&#xA;          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must&#xA;          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained&#xA;          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not&#xA;          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one&#xA;          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed&#xA;          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or&#xA;          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,&#xA;          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and&#xA;          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents&#xA;          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and&#xA;          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution&#xA;          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside&#xA;          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided&#xA;          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed&#xA;          as modifying the License.&#xA;&#xA;      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and&#xA;      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions&#xA;      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or&#xA;      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,&#xA;      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with&#xA;      the conditions stated in this License.&#xA;&#xA;   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,&#xA;      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work&#xA;      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of&#xA;      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.&#xA;      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify&#xA;      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed&#xA;      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.&#xA;&#xA;   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade&#xA;      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,&#xA;      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the&#xA;      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.&#xA;&#xA;   7.

You are solely responsible for determining the&#xA;      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any&#xA;      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.&#xA;&#xA;   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,&#xA;      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,&#xA;      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly&#xA;      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be&#xA;      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,&#xA;      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a&#xA;      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the&#xA;      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,&#xA;      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all&#xA;      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor&#xA;      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&#xA;&#xA;   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing&#xA;      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,&#xA;      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&#xA;      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&#xA;      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only&#xA;      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf&#xA;      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,&#xA;      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability&#xA;      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason&#xA;      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&#xA;&#xA;   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.&#xA;&#xA;      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following&#xA;      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets &quot;[]&quot;&#xA;      replaced with your own identifying information.

If You&#xA;      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a&#xA;      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work&#xA;      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct&#xA;      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses&#xA;      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate&#xA;      as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the&#xA;      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without&#xA;      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You&#xA;      meet the following conditions:&#xA;&#xA;      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or&#xA;          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and&#xA;&#xA;      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;          stating that You changed the files; and&#xA;&#xA;      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works&#xA;          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and&#xA;          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,&#xA;          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of&#xA;          the Derivative Works; and&#xA;&#xA;      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its&#xA;          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must&#xA;          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained&#xA;          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not&#xA;          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one&#xA;          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed&#xA;          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or&#xA;          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,&#xA;          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and&#xA;          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents&#xA;          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and&#xA;          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution&#xA;          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside&#xA;          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided&#xA;          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed&#xA;          as modifying the License.&#xA;&#xA;      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and&#xA;      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions&#xA;      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or&#xA;      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,&#xA;      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with&#xA;      the conditions stated in this License.&#xA;&#xA;   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,&#xA;      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work&#xA;      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of&#xA;      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.&#xA;      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify&#xA;      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed&#xA;      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.&#xA;&#xA;   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade&#xA;      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,&#xA;      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the&#xA;      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.&#xA;&#xA;   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or&#xA;      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each&#xA;      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,&#xA;      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or&#xA;      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions&#xA;      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A&#xA;      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the&#xA;      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any&#xA;      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.&#xA;&#xA;   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,&#xA;      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,&#xA;      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly&#xA;      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be&#xA;      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,&#xA;      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a&#xA;      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the&#xA;      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,&#xA;      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all&#xA;      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor&#xA;      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&#xA;&#xA;   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing&#xA;      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,&#xA;      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&#xA;      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&#xA;      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only&#xA;      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf&#xA;      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,&#xA;      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability&#xA;      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason&#xA;      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&#xA;&#xA;   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.&#xA;&#xA;      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following&#xA;      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets &quot;[]&quot;&#xA;      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don&apos;t include&#xA;      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate&#xA;      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a&#xA;      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the&#xA;      same &quot;printed page&quot; as the copyright notice for easier&#xA;      identification within third-party archives.&#xA;&#xA;   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]&#xA;&#xA;   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;);&#xA;   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.&#xA;   You may obtain a copy of the License at&#xA;&#xA;       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0&#xA;&#xA;   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software&#xA;   distributed under the License is distributed on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,&#xA;   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.&#xA;   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and&#xA;   limitations under the License.

You may add Your own attribution&#xA;          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside&#xA;          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided&#xA;          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed&#xA;          as modifying the License.&#xA;&#xA;      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and&#xA;      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions&#xA;      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or&#xA;      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,&#xA;      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with&#xA;      the conditions stated in this License.&#xA;&#xA;   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,&#xA;      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work&#xA;      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of&#xA;      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.&#xA;      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify&#xA;      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed&#xA;      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.&#xA;&#xA;   6.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing&#xA;      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,&#xA;      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&#xA;      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&#xA;      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only&#xA;      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf&#xA;      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,&#xA;      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability&#xA;      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason&#xA;      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&#xA;&#xA;   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.&#xA;&#xA;      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following&#xA;      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets &quot;[]&quot;&#xA;      replaced with your own identifying information.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,&#xA;      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work&#xA;      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of&#xA;      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.&#xA;      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify&#xA;      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed&#xA;      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.&#xA;&#xA;   6.

If You&#xA;      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a&#xA;      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work&#xA;      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct&#xA;      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses&#xA;      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate&#xA;      as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the&#xA;      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without&#xA;      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You&#xA;      meet the following conditions:&#xA;&#xA;      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or&#xA;          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and&#xA;&#xA;      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;          stating that You changed the files; and&#xA;&#xA;      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works&#xA;          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and&#xA;          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,&#xA;          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of&#xA;          the Derivative Works; and&#xA;&#xA;      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its&#xA;          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must&#xA;          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained&#xA;          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not&#xA;          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one&#xA;          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed&#xA;          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or&#xA;          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,&#xA;          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and&#xA;          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents&#xA;          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and&#xA;          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution&#xA;          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside&#xA;          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided&#xA;          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed&#xA;          as modifying the License.&#xA;&#xA;      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and&#xA;      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions&#xA;      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or&#xA;      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,&#xA;      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with&#xA;      the conditions stated in this License.&#xA;&#xA;   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,&#xA;      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work&#xA;      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of&#xA;      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.&#xA;      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify&#xA;      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed&#xA;      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.&#xA;&#xA;   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade&#xA;      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,&#xA;      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the&#xA;      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.&#xA;&#xA;   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or&#xA;      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each&#xA;      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,&#xA;      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or&#xA;      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions&#xA;      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A&#xA;      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the&#xA;      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any&#xA;      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.&#xA;&#xA;   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,&#xA;      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,&#xA;      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly&#xA;      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be&#xA;      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,&#xA;      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a&#xA;      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the&#xA;      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,&#xA;      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all&#xA;      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor&#xA;      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&#xA;&#xA;   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing&#xA;      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,&#xA;      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&#xA;      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&#xA;      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only&#xA;      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf&#xA;      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,&#xA;      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability&#xA;      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason&#xA;      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&#xA;&#xA;   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.&#xA;&#xA;      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following&#xA;      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets &quot;[]&quot;&#xA;      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don&apos;t include&#xA;      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate&#xA;      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a&#xA;      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the&#xA;      same &quot;printed page&quot; as the copyright notice for easier&#xA;      identification within third-party archives.&#xA;&#xA;   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]&#xA;&#xA;   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;);&#xA;   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.&#xA;   You may obtain a copy of the License at&#xA;&#xA;       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0&#xA;&#xA;   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software&#xA;   distributed under the License is distributed on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,&#xA;   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.&#xA;   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and&#xA;   limitations under the License.

For the purposes&#xA;      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain&#xA;      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,&#xA;      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.&#xA;&#xA;      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including&#xA;      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions&#xA;      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally&#xA;      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner&#xA;      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of&#xA;      the copyright owner.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of&#xA;      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,&#xA;      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable&#xA;      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,&#xA;      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,&#xA;      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable&#xA;      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their&#xA;      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)&#xA;      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You&#xA;      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a&#xA;      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work&#xA;      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct&#xA;      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses&#xA;      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate&#xA;      as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the&#xA;      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without&#xA;      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You&#xA;      meet the following conditions:&#xA;&#xA;      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or&#xA;          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and&#xA;&#xA;      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;          stating that You changed the files; and&#xA;&#xA;      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works&#xA;          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and&#xA;          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,&#xA;          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of&#xA;          the Derivative Works; and&#xA;&#xA;      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its&#xA;          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must&#xA;          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained&#xA;          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not&#xA;          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one&#xA;          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed&#xA;          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or&#xA;          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,&#xA;          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and&#xA;          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents&#xA;          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and&#xA;          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution&#xA;          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside&#xA;          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided&#xA;          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed&#xA;          as modifying the License.&#xA;&#xA;      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and&#xA;      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions&#xA;      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or&#xA;      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,&#xA;      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with&#xA;      the conditions stated in this License.&#xA;&#xA;   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,&#xA;      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work&#xA;      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of&#xA;      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.&#xA;      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify&#xA;      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed&#xA;      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.&#xA;&#xA;   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade&#xA;      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,&#xA;      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the&#xA;      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.&#xA;&#xA;   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or&#xA;      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each&#xA;      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,&#xA;      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or&#xA;      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions&#xA;      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A&#xA;      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the&#xA;      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any&#xA;      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.&#xA;&#xA;   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,&#xA;      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,&#xA;      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly&#xA;      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be&#xA;      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,&#xA;      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a&#xA;      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the&#xA;      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,&#xA;      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all&#xA;      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor&#xA;      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&#xA;&#xA;   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing&#xA;      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,&#xA;      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&#xA;      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&#xA;      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only&#xA;      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf&#xA;      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,&#xA;      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability&#xA;      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason&#xA;      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&#xA;&#xA;   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.&#xA;&#xA;      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following&#xA;      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets &quot;[]&quot;&#xA;      replaced with your own identifying information.
